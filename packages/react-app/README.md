## Project Description
Welcome to our Climate Initiative, an innovative solution built on the Celo Blockchain that focuses on reducing our carbon footprint. This application presents a unique opportunity for users to offset carbon credits by redeeming NCT for TC02, a process that directly contributes to the environmental well-being.

In addition to its primary function, the application includes a swap functionality built on the celo mainnet that allows users to exchange various Celo tokens for NCT. These NCT tokens can then be redeemed for TC02 and retired, thus offsetting carbon credits.

This project taps into the power of blockchain technology to contribute to climate change mitigation efforts. It establishes a transparent and reliable platform where individuals can make a tangible impact on the global climate.

## Usecases
1. **Redeeming NCT for TC02**: Users can directly offset carbon credits by redeeming their NCT for TC02. This mechanism aids in the reduction of the carbon footprint and promotes a healthier environment.

2. **Swapping Celo Tokens for NCT**: The application provides a swapping feature, where users can exchange their different Celo tokens for NCT. 

3. **Carbon Offset**: The tokens acquired can then be redeemed for TC02 and retired, contributing to carbon offsetting.

## How It Works
1. **Get NCT Faucet**: Start by getting some NCT faucet from the [toucan faucet](https://faucet.toucan.earth/).

2. **Swapping Tokens**: Users can navigate to the swap feature, where they can exchange their Celo tokens for NCT.

3. **Redeeming NCT for TC02**: After acquiring NCT tokens, users can redeem these for TC02.

4. **Retiring Tokens for Carbon Offset**: The TC02 tokens can then be retired, directly contributing to offsetting carbon credits. Each retired token represents a 1 tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent that has been prevented from entering the atmosphere.

## Next Steps
Our team is committed to continuously improve and expand the functionality of this application. Our next steps include:

1. **Providing liquidity to facilitate swapping**: We plan to provide liquidity to the NCT/CELO pool to facilitate swapping.

2. **Integrating More Tokens**: We aim to include more token types for swapping and redeeming, providing more options for users and increasing the usage of our platform.

3. **Partnerships with Environmental Organizations**: We are in the process of partnering with various environmental organizations to raise awareness about the climate crisis and enhance the impact of our application.

By using our application, you take a step towards a more sustainable future. We welcome you to join us in our journey to combat climate change.
